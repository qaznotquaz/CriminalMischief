This is a somewhat interactive simulator for digging through the archives of a fictional messaging service and reading old snippets from conversations. The aim is simply to learn about the characters presented through those conversations. A user should have a 'criminal mischief.exe' and a 'config.txt', as well as a 1.8 JRE. Interaction with the program is done entirely through the config file, which is only named as such to present the image of playing with the internal settings of a program. Once the user has specified the settings they want, they can run the executable and it will present a snippet of conversation based on the configuration settings specified (if an applicable one exists).

Internally, all snippets are contained in the src/jason/storyteller/snippets directory. I've added this folder to the .gitignore, though, so that people can't accidentally (or intentionally) spoil themselves.
